What I haven’t learnt from my Youtube creative endeavours.
I can make a video out of it and this be the script
I uploaded my first video on feb 2017. Which got over 21k likes in four years. In the same year I posted four more videos around the same concept. And one on another channel.
(last year I put two more videos poetry. I wanted to do visual poetry)
(rap is also poetry)
(music and poetry my thing video concept and visualisation too but shooting and editing not so much)
(girls voice, see my voice change in the videos)
(my metric for counting success was views and that was my primary objective to get views)
Yeah a 15 year old kid explaining one of the world’s most dangerous conflict to the internet. That what MUN does to a guy’s confidence.
Anyways, we go back to why I made the first video.
Back in  9th grade I made two new friends. Vaikunth and Christian. Yes these guys. Christian introduced me to this channel “Epic rap battles of history.” Where famous personalities and historical figures have a fictional rap battle among themselves. I used to memories these battles, like we all do with songs. 
We loved the channel and their concept so much that we wanted to make one ourselves. So the three of us wrote lyrics and I sang it with some copyright music from the internet. Took the clips from both these movies and turned it into this.
Now it was not bad for a first time singer, Im not tone deaf its just the recording setup was not perfect, (horn sounds) neither the environment.
Then I turned solo and made four more such music videos which got few hundred views.
